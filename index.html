        <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It's a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players â€“ field players and a goalkeeper. ... He's the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area.</p>
